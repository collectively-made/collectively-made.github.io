<dt>Goal</dt> <dd>more responsive student technology services</dd>
<dt>Challenge</dt> <dd>how can Student Technology get more insight about the demand for their services</dd>
</dl>

Student Technology is a team of the Information Technology department at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. Formally known as Student Technology Training, the team primarily conducted workshops for students about university supported technologies.

With the advent of online resources like Lynda.com and even Youtube, the demand for learning based on the lecture model was declining. New requests for their services were given, but had not yet been formalized. They were facing a rapidly changing market demand and had no way understanding the changes in a way that they could respond to the demand systematically.

We understood right away that this was a complex problem where there was no one right solution. It also meant that best practices from other universities would only help identify possible ideas for programming, but would not tell them why one set of practices would work better than others in for their market.

Their complex problems needed a different set of tactics to help them establish a system that they could use to keep up with the changing demand. We conceptualized a system that would help them monitor the demand changes of students. The solution we created allowed them to also track demographical data specific to educational settings such as major and year in school.

With this information Student Technology gained the ability to understand what new services were needed by students. They now could make more informed decisions about what services to try, which services to formalize and scale up, and which services to abandon so they could redirect their time and efforts to better programming.
