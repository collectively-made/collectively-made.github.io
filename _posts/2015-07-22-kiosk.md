<!-- Scan NCARD for quick information about the student.

- What information needs to be accessed? 
- What if I don’t have my NCARD? 
- My NCARD is in my wallet, and I’m lazy. 
- Scanner locked in or on a chord? 
- Can I type in the info on my own? 
- Is bypassing the scan an option? 
- Is quick access scan, like access to buildings on campus, an option? 
- Do I have to scan the barcode?
- It’s in my wallet, facefront. Barcode is on the back.  

Again, I’m lazy. 

- Do I just have to overcome my laziness? 
- If people can get their NCARDS out to go to the Rec, they can get it out 

for Tech-KNOWLEDGE-y? 

- Options for both exist. 
- On a chord might be a hassle in the office (Brace) 
- It might be a benefit in some of the more public kiosks. -->
