## The web should empower, not frustrate
We design visual interfaces (what people see and how they use it) for web sites and applications. We focus on making sure these sites are both useful and easy to use.

## How you fit in
We work with smart clients who understand that it's the customer, not org-charts or office politics, that matters most. These clients are hard to find, so when we get them we treat them well.

## This site is a look into our minds
Inside you'll find our philosophy for simplicity in design, our influences, and ideas that drive us.
