## We work for organizations, brands, and ourselves. We work for fun.

Collectively Made is a creative collective and design studio that is dedicated to the craft of interface &amp; function. The collective structure allows us to curate the best talents and collaborate as an agile unit that can work on diverse and experimenting projects.

## We work strategically and creatively

with all of our clients to secure an original output that communicates clearly and solves the problem. The range of projects we have been mandated includes everything from website & mobile application design, to kiosk hardware.

## We believe technology should empower, not frustrate
We design interfaces (what people interact with) for web sites, applications, and hardware. We focus on making sure our creations are both useful and easy to use.
